This program is an implementation of the Queen-McCluskey algorithm. Initially, minterms or maxterms are categorized according to Heming's distance. They are then merged if they can be merged into a larger cube. Non-integrated cube is considered as the primary implicant(PI) and the primary implicant that include at least one essential minterm or maxterm are considered as essential primary implicant(EPI). Finally, using the algebra of propositions, the desired output is generated. Amin Shayan Asl
